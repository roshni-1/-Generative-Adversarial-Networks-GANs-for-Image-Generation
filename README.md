# -Generative-Adversarial-Networks-GANs-for-Image-Generation
This project demonstrates how to implement Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) using the MNIST dataset. GANs are a class of machine learning frameworks designed by Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues in 2014. The goal is to generate new data samples that resemble the training data.
